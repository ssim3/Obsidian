## Far Leg Positioning

### Keep instep inside opponents knee

![[Pasted image 20250616173941.png]]

- This positioning allows for you to keep readjusting if your opponent backsteps, keeping your hips under your opponents hips

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Arm Positioning

### Keep Arm Tight

![[Pasted image 20250616174244.png]]

- Focus on getting a deep elbow grip and keeping elbow close to chest
- Prevents opponent from pulling leg out and running away

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Keep Opponents Hands to the Mat

![[Pasted image 20250616174813.png]]

- Keeping opponents hand to the mat prevents escapes and allows for easier transitions to advantageous positions (E.g. Back Mount) or submissions
- Look to lighten near leg by kicking opponent away, look to turn near knee into opponents knee and bring entire body to the side

![[Pasted image 20250616172108.png]]

- If opponent is looking to free foot on the hip, look to transition foot on hip to a hook on opponents inner thigh

![[Pasted image 20250616172314.png]]

- Opponent will bring weight onto the leg that is being attacked. Counter by kicking them away in order to lighten and keep the attacked leg off the ground.
