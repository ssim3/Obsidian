- Look to keep elbows pointed upward to the ceiling and keep active torque on the arm
- Look to load opponent onto your hips by falling back
- Opponent will usually get into a four point to prevent the sweep and stay on top
- Look to elevate with butterfly hook, kick leg post with free leg and elevate chin with elbows **KEEP ACTIVE TORQUE ON THE TRAPPED ARM.
