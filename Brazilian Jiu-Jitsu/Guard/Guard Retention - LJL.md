# 1. Positioning

- Always keep knees close to chest
- Head and shoulder should always be inside knees, conversely, knees should always be outside centre line
- Always have the foot pointing towards your opponent, this way, your first line of defense is the foot and not the knees/shins
- Hip switching - Using an elbow post to switch your hips whenever opponents start walking to your side
