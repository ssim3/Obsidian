- Involves locking gable grip behind opponents elbow and turning their arms into their body and rolling through such that their trapped arm is on top

## Details to take note of

- Make sure that opponents head is on your chest

- Before squeezing the choke, look to hook your legs onto opponents legs to prevent their hips from running away

- If opponent is running their hips and legs away, roll over on top with mounted anaconda finish

- To ensure that the choke is deep; when in turtle, use gable grip to collapse elbow, use left leg to ensure elbow stays collapsed, then adjust choking arm deeper, before rolling over and finishing the choke
