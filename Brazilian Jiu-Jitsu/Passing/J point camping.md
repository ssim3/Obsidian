- Passing style used to threaten the pass and force bottom opponent to expend energy to re-guard or reset the position
- Eventually opponent will be so tired that you can pass easily (e.g. [[Chest to Chest Half Guard Passing]])

## Steps

1. get opponent supine
2. work on outflanking the opponent
3. control inside position (control the area between inner thigh and torso)
4. make them carry your body weight with their frames
5. force them to re-guard/reset position
6. complete the pass once they are tired or end in half guard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. use shoulder posts, and ankle picks on a seated opponent to get them supine, mix them up, if the opponent has hand on the ground, he cannot protect his ankles as effectively.

2. use double c grips with thumbs facing the direction where you are flanking on the shins, use one c grip one inverted v grip on the far leg.

	2a.if guard player allows for you to keep their knees to their chest and lift their lower back off the mat, you can punish them by rotating them to help you cut the angle.

3. cross step to cut angles, if opponent does a good job in following the cross step, go to the other side and force them to use energy to have to face you again.

	3a. keep knee or foot in front of opponents hips in order to keep them under threat of being passed, key idea that helps you stay at a flanked angle, keeps pressure on them to keep framing away and expanding energy to deny your pass

4. after cutting the angle and gain inside position (knee and hip post) 

	4a. stop the near side leg by keeping reverse shin on shin, keeping your leg unweighted, keeping their heel to their butt. if they hip escape away, follow through with them, most of your weight should be on the hip post and your lead leg.
	
	4b. most common reaction is to frame away with both hands (cross shoulder frame or double shoulder frames), use unweighting and redirecting frames as a way to tire opponent.
	
	 4c. use concave and convex body positioning to keep opponent trying to create space. If opponent is framing on shoulders and is making space, use chest on near side leg and sprawl to turn them away, keep your hips connected. if opponent is framing on hips, shrimping away, go back to concave/ normal camping position 
	
	4d. to prevent the lassoing of the far leg onto the bicep, keep your ear to your bicep in order to make that difficult
