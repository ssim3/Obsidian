### Definition

Combining two or more simple [[Functions]] by chaining them together to build a more complicated function.
$$
fg(x)=f(g(x)) = z
$$
**Example**s

Consider the functions
$g : R+ → R+$ given by $g(x) = √x$  
$f : R → R+$ defined by $f(x) = x²$.

The composite function $f ∘ g(x) = (√x)² = x$ is defined for all non-negative reals.

The composite function g ∘ f is defined for all real numbers, and we have  
g ∘ f(x) = √(x²) = |x|.

	Basically look at the starting set before the arrow, and the ending set after the arrow, and take note of the type of set.
