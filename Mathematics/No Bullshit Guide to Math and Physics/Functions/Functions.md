### Definition

A function is a mathematical object that takes numbers as inputs and produces numbers as outputs. 

A function is not a number. It is a mapping of numbers to numbers.
$$
 f : A \to B 
$$
- **A**:  Source set of the function, the types of numbers that the function takes as inputs.
- **Dom(f)** : the domain of a function is the set of allowed input values for the function.
- **B** : Target set of a function describes the type of outputs the function has. a.k.a **Codomain**
- **Im(f)** : Image of the function, set of all possible output values of the function. a.k.a **the range**

### 3 Properties of Functions

**Injective Functions (One-To-One)**

- If there are two distinct input points $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, then there will be two distinct points $f(x_{1})$ and $f(x_{2})$ in the output.
- The function $f$ is injective if the equation *f*(x) = *b* has at *most* one solution for every number *b*.

**Surjective Functions**

- Every number in the target set $B$ is a possible output of the function $f$ for some input.
- The function $f$ is surjective if the equation *f*(x) = *b* has at *least* one solution for every number *b*.

**Bijective Functions**

- Both injective and surjective. 
- For every input value x, there is exactly one corresponding output value y
- For every output value y, there is exactly one input value x.
