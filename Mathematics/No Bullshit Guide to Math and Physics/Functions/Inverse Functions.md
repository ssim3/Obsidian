### Definition

The "undo" process of a function. 
$$
f^{-1}(f(x)) = x
$$
### Every Bijective [[Functions]] has an inverse function. 

**Without injective property**
- Two inputs $x_1$ $x_2$ that produce same output f(x) = $f(x_2)$ = y
- Compute $f^{-1}(x)$ would be impossible as we don't know which input was used to produce the output y.

**Without surjective property**
- Computing $f^{-1}(x)$ would be impossible as some output values y are not mapped by any input values x.

Hence, Only Bijective functions have inverse functions. 

### Restrictions

Why do we often see the function $f(x) = x^2$ having an inverse of $f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{(x)}$?

The function  $f(x) = x^2$ is  bijective when $f:R+\to R+$, hence we are able to regard only positive values of y and hence positive values of x.
