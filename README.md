### Welcome! 
Welcome to Poros! This repository is a backup of my entire obsidian vault consisting of notes from all the different areas of study I am currently learning. Feel free to explore my notes and keep up with the different topics that I've been delving into :D

### What is πόρος (<i>poros</i>)?
Poros is a Greek word meaning “resource” or “opening.” The name reflects the idea behind my Obsidian vault. It's meant to be a growing repository of notes that becomes a richer resource and expands my understanding the more and more I add to it.
